  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root app component that manages game state (menu vs active game), stores quality/hardcore settings, and renders either MainMenu or GameScene based on whether the game has started.",
  "frontend/src/components/MainMenu.tsx": "Styled main menu with PRO BATTLE ROYALE title, graphics quality dropdown (Low/Medium/High/4K Ultra), hardcore mode checkbox toggle, controls reference, and a Deploy button that starts the game.",
  "frontend/src/components/GameScene.tsx": "Main 3D game scene using React Three Fiber Canvas with terrain, fog, lighting, and all game subsystems (PlayerController, EnemyBots, LootCrates, ZoneRing, HUD). Manages shared game state (health, armor, ammo, enemies, fps) and renders game-over screen.",
  "frontend/src/components/PlayerController.tsx": "First-person player controller using useFrame and useThree; handles WASD movement, pointer-lock mouse look (yaw/pitch), sprint with stamina depletion/recovery, and hitscan shooting via raycaster on click.",
  "frontend/src/components/EnemyBots.tsx": "Spawns 15 red box enemy bots at random positions; each frame checks distance to player, transitions to chase state within 100 units, moves toward player at speed 4, and deals proximity damage when within 3 units. Removes dead enemies hit by raycaster.",
